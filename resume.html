              <p>
                I'm a designer, programmer, artist, and tinker-er. I 
                use technology to design interactions between people 
                and machines, especially in the context of music and 
                play.
              </p>

              <h1>WORK EXPERIENCE</h1>
              <h2><strong>Fabricator & Researcher</strong> / HARDCELL installation by Judith Barry</h2>
              <h3>May 2023-Present</h3>
              <p>Tested and programmed motors, sensors, screens, pumps, and robots. Fabricated housing for these elements and integrated them into the installation. Developed Raspberry Pi code and circuits to control the installation. The installation is a large crate containing a variety of 37 mechanical + media devices that are activated via sensors when viewers engage with it. I helped update the original version to 21st century technology and also added new features.</p>
              <h2><strong>UI/UX Designer & Programmer</strong> / 21M.180 Web Interface</h2>
              <h3>June-August 2023</h3>
              <p>Built an online user interface from scratch using p5.js and webaudio. It was used for a music tech class at MIT where students used live coding to create digital music.</p>
              <h2><strong>Research Assistant</strong> / Politecnico di Milano Material Balance Lab</h2>
              <h3>May-Jul 2022</h3>
              <p>Used AI image generation and motion tracking to create an interactive installation and website for an exhibition that explores materials in the metaverse. Created animations for the lab's first NFTs.</p>
              <h2><strong>Research Assistant</strong> / MIT Self-Assembly Lab</h2>
              <h3>Jun-Aug 2021</h3>
              <p>Maldives Island: Designed and made laser-cut or 3D-printed prototype structures for creating natural sand accumulation in the Maldives. Designed and ran wave and current simulations in a water tank.
                Airbus: Designed and ran force tests, analyzed data for lattice structures used for robot crash protection.
              </p>
              <h2><strong>Research Assistant</strong> / MIT Digital Structures</h2>
              <h3>Jun 2020-Jan 2021</h3>
              <p>Created a web interface to aid the sketching process and facilitate design exploration and creative workflows. Used different models (CNNs, RNNs, VAEs) to analyze sketches and generate new designs while allowing for direct manipulation of latent variables so that users can navigate the full range of design generation.</p>
