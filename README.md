# My Personal Portfolio

This is the second version I built, I used the first one to learn how to code websites so it was pretty jank. This one was also built pretty early in my coding journey and I wanna make the next version in React. 

Some fun stuff I did with this one was using scans of my handwriting for some the text on links and using various custom handrawn cursors, although I can't tell how well those are working since they sometimes dissapear for me lol. Although I know that building a site without React or some other framework is not very efficient I still enjoy the challenge of making certain components that are harder to make with just html/js and figuring out ways to build those quicker.
