            A collection of experiments I made during the IMS class. We used python to code and generate audio and Kivy for the graphics.

            Audio is pretty bad since it's recorded from my laptop speakers, which are slightly broken. Hopefully I can figure out how to embed the projects here so they can be used.

                During this week, we remade a simple version of Guitar Hero and had to put our own spin on it.
                I realized pacman graphics fit pretty well with guitar hero. For the gems I used something similar to the dots that pacman eats and the buttons are all pacman heads that are eating the gems if you hit them at the right time. I also wanted the GH streak mode to mimic when pacman eats a cherry and starts eating the ghosts. Unfortunately I ran into some problems and ran out of time so i was not able to turn the gems into ghosts. Instead, when you hit a cherry gem, the gems all turn blue and the points for each one are multiplied by 2. I also wanted to make the cherry appear after you hit a streak of ten, but again ran into issues/out of time so I just placed the cherries in 3 random spots when initializing the gems. Once you miss a note the cherry mode will deactivate.

                During this week, we played around with a Leap Motion sensor that can track your hand and finger position! I tried to create a system that mimics a harp as closely as possible.
                I thought it was kinda basic at first, but it was actually pretty fun trying to figure out how to do this. For the sound of the strings I used a very staccato sine wave (to mimic the initial pluck sound) stacked on top of a quieter but longer sine wave (to mimic the ringing of the string). I also messed around with stacking triangle waves and different decays and even tremolo, but it started to sound very crunchy and I decided to move on due to time constraints. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I was also somewhat inspired by traditional Mexican music, which sometimes uses the harp. Some of this music tends to have a lot of thirds in the harmonies so each string plays a note from C Major and also the third above it. I chose to only have 8 strings since having more would make the gaps between them too narrow for the leap system which isn't super accurate for something like this. But to mimic the full range of the harp you can go up or down an octave if you pluck it higher or lower in the y-axis.
                <br>
                <br>
                Finally, I added a simple bass line that I know from a mariachi song and since I didn't have time to add interactive buttons, I thought a fun way to activate it would be to strum very quickly since that's something that I see harp players to sometimes as a flourish.

            <h2 class="alignLeft">Trumpet Solo Arpeggiator</h2>

                During this week, we learned how to make arpeggiators with a note scheduler! 
                I used to play trumpet and some of my favorite trumpet 
                solos come from salsa songs, so I wanted to create something 
                similar to that type of sound. The backing track loops chords that I took from Ditto by NewJeans and I also added some salsa sounding percussion. 
                The arpegiator used the midi trumpet sound 
                and follows a simple mapping of pitch on the x axis and note
                speed on the y axis. For the pitch I limited it to playing 
                arpeggios based on the backing chords along with a couple of extra 
                notes to make it more interesting. By moving left and right 
                you can play these notes in three different octaves. The graphics 
                for this one were pretty simple as there is just a ripple going on 
                in the background that matches the rhythm of the chords and for the 
                arpegiator it's size is related to the note length and the shape 
                changes based on the pitch. I limited it to 8 different shapes since 
                each arpeggio won't span much more than that.

                During this week, we learned how to animate collisions and also 
                make keyframe animations. My system is based on the plinko carnival game. When a ball reaches the bottom 
                it lands on one of eight pads and plays a note. Each pad has an assigned 
                pitch, but the ball's color will determine the wave type of the 
                generated note. The ball changes color/waveshape each time it bounces on the white 
                circles. The system is pretty chaotic/random so I could definetely 
                work on adding things that make it more musically pleasing, but I 
                wanted to focus more on getting the graphics and physics working corretly.
